There were alot of multiple classes with the same details so I renamed it to 1 name. "benefit" and combined 3 seperate classes with the same css effect.

There were other similar classes so I combined the 3 and named it "para" as in paraphrase.

The classes were disorganized and in the wrong order and I rearranged it to my opinion as organized in accordance to the html.

I changed many <div>'s into their respective section names.
I used mainly <sections> but placed them within <Article> and <Aside>'s.
